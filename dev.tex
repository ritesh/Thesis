\label{ch:dev}
In this chapter the design and implementation of the experimental setup are discussed. The web crawler and the analysis module generate results that are stored in the database.
\section Web Scraper
A scraper allows an application to retrieve specific items from a web page. It consists of two main components, a web crawler that allows it to parse a large number of pages quickly and a scraping module that allows for the extraction of relevant content. A number of free and open source projects are available that provide both kinds of functionality. For this project, scrapy was used as the basis for the web scraper based on previous evaluations and it's excellent database connectivity options. Scrapy is a python web framework that can be used to build web crawlers/scrapers. It was designed to use pageScrapy in itself does not provide an implemention of a scraper, it simply provides a number of interfaces that can be used to create a web scraper.
